[Sidelight](https://sidelight.kerjo.com) is a simple app to display colors on a screen. Sometimes you need a little extra light or color and finding a lamp isn't worth the effort.

Use it during video calls by pulling it up in a new window, picking a color that suits your environment, and making it as large or small as you want.

Or open it on your phone and use it to add light to a photo.

### Controls

There are preset, environment-matching colors along the bottom. Simply click one to switch to it immediately.

When loading the page, it will always choose a random color to start with. If you'd like to consistently load a specific color, just add the hex code to the url hash.

Choose a color using the color picker on the right, or type a hex value directly on the left.

Clicking anywhere in the colored area will fade out the controls and presets. Click again to bring them back.
